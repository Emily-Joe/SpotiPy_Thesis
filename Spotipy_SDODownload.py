def check_path(path, folder):
    '''
    checks if a specific directionary ('folder') in a path already exists and creates it, if not.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path:   string
            gives the path in which the wanted directionary should be in

    folder: string
            the name of the folder/directionary, that should be checked for its existence or be created, if it does not already exist
    Returns
    -------
    folder_path
        string, a combined path to the folder that was checked/created
